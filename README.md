## TicketQueue 
This project uses the Queue data structure to create a Ticket Queue system. The project is a simple console issue reporting system that was simply designed to simulate a ticket managment system. Users can create, remove and manage tickets in a queue.

# Features:

- Built in Java

- creates new tickets by accepting a user input

- Contains a method to remove the first ticket from the queue once the issue is "resolved"

- Contains methods thatCan Display the first and last tickets in the list

- Contains a method that can find the users specific ticket, and return the position of the ticket.

# Future fixes and improvments:

- The project could use a ID or user authentication system as retreving the ticekts by using its description could cause duplicates and, inefficent if ticket descriptions are long

- Implementing a database or file system for ticket storage to transform the project from a simulation into a real ticketing system.

- A graphical interface system.
